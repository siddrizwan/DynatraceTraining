# Architecture of Dynatrace

### Dynatrace SaaS Model

This is how a typical dynatrace saas deployment looks like from the high level view. You send the data using oneagent from your data center to the Dynatrace Cluster in the AWS Cloud environment. 

Basically everything is being managed by Dynatrace you are just consuming there services.

When checking in the deep what really happens when the data leaves the data center it lands up on AWS Route 53 and then via the embedded activegate it reaches the Cluster Server. 

The Cluster Server processes the data at its end and stores it in Casandra (Timeseries Metrics) & Elastic Cluster (User Session, Logs Etc.)

----------------------------------------

### Dynatrace Managed Model

This is how a typical managed deployment looks like from an high level view. You host the Dynatrace Setup in your environment and managed everything internally and dynatrace will take care if the cluster is healthy, unresponsive or down etc.

Basically you are using Dynatrace to Monitor your application and in the Background dynatrace mission control is taking care of the health.

When we talk about the managed architecture everything which is deployed in the SaaS is being deployed in you own datacenter such as Cassnadra Database, Elastic Cluster, Embedded ActiveGate & Dynatrace Server etc.

The flow of the data within Dynatrace remains the same be it be within your datacenter or SaaS environment.
